## Projects

**Project: DISCORDIA - Uncovering Patterns of Parliamentary Dissent**

Working at the LSE Data Science Institute on a research project exploring the realm of political dissent within the UK Parliament. We created a parliamentary speech database upon which we aim to iidentify indicators in MP's speeches that may suggest a likelihood of them rebelling against party lines. Using a combination of data science and political analysis, we aim to gain insights into the nuances of parliamentary dissent. We're experimenting with various machine learning models and investigating the use of explainable AI to enhance our analysis.
